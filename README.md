# RBM
 Restricted Boltzmann Machine and Deep Belief Network

# Project overview
The aim of this project is to extract non-linear features in an unsupervised fashion, by building and training a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and/or a Deep Belief Network (DBN).
The modules are composed by four classes:
- Data: for data managing
- RBM: for RBM building and training
- DBN: for DBN building and training 
- ParameterTuner: for hyperparameter optimization
 
 Here two examples are provided:
 - example1: initialize and train an RBM.
 - example2: parameter optimization of a DBN.
